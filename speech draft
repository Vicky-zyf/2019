# Which style do you prefer

## 1 
Today, my story background is a boss Lee asks his subordinate Johnson to arrange the annual engineer seminar, I will show you two different occasions, 

### Occasion 1,

Lee said: Johnson, here comes the annual seminal, so please arrange it.
J: ok. (J take the profiles and ready to go for implement the task.)
L: Come back,please repeat what I have said.
J:You asked me to arrange for the annual engineer seminar,is that right?
Lee nodded his head.
J:Then can I go to do the task now?
L:(think a while),:Not in a rush, so do you know my purpose for the seminar you are going to arrange?
J:I think the purpose for the seminal is strength our reputation in the market, is that right?
L (nodded head again)
J: then I can go for the task now?
L:oh, come back,Take a while to estimate what kinds of situation you will meet?  what kinds of situation you will report to me? Then what situations you can make decision by yourself?
J: generally, I will entercount the a , b, c , d situations,if I meet A and b, I think I can make decision by myself, if I meet C and d, I must report to you immediatery, is it okay?
Lee nodded his head. 
When J is going to leave Lee’s office
L raised his voice again:Hey,Comeback.if you are going to lead the project, what’s your opinions or actions to take?,
J have a deep thinking,at last he gives his opinions and actions to take, L give comments for his thoughts. All things clear, Then J goes for implement the task accordingly.
```

### Occasion 2:
```
L: hear is the task for you, please finished it on time.
J: yes.then could you give me some instructions for the task.
L:Read the files carefully, don't always rely on asking me.
J:got it.J take the seminal profile, and go to do it according his understanding for the paper information.
Three days later, Lee talk with J
Hey, what did you do? I didn’t receive any feedback from you.
J:you didn’t mention that feedback is required, I have done according the profile. 
L:then why you booked such a luxry place, the expense is over our budget.
J:I think we have no budget limitation for the seminal, I just want to achieve our target to gain a good reputation.
Certainly L was very angry for the result.

See, different leader style, different result, you may feel there is a little tedious talking between L and J in Occasion 1, But everything goes well according the expectation, so repeating is necessary in our daily work, repeating is a declaration to understand the task well, repeating is an emphasis to take a caution attitude. so whichever you leader style is in the past, try to repeating, you will gain more than the cost you spend on repeating.

# Which style do you prefer

## 1 
Today, my story background is a boss Lee asked his subordinate Johnson to arrange the annual engineer seminar,as you know, the annual seminar is significant for the whole industry. so it's a big thing for the sponsor. I will show you two different occasions, please listen carefuly, and then tell me what style do you prefer.

### Occasion 1,

Lee said: Johnson, here comes the annual seminal, so please arrange it.
J: ok. (J take the profiles and ready to go for implement the task.)
L: Come back,please repeat what I have said.
J:You asked me to arrange for the annual engineer seminar,is that right?
Lee nodded his head.
J:Then can I go to do the task now?
L:(think a while),:Not in a rush, so do you know my purpose for the seminar you are going to arrange?
J:I think the purpose for the seminal is strength our reputation in the market, is that right?
L (nodded head again)
J: then I can go for the task now?
L:oh, come back,Take a while to estimate what kinds of situation you will meet?  what kinds of situation you will report to me? Then what situations you can make decision by yourself?
J replied: generally, I will entercount the a , b, c , d situations,if I meet A and b, I think I can make decision by myself, if I meet C and d, I must report to you immediatery, is it okay?
Lee approved. 
When J is going to leave Lee’s office
L raised his voice again:Hey,Comeback.if you are going to lead the project, what’s your opinions or actions to take?,
J have a deep thinking,at last he gives his opinions and actions to take, L give comments for his thoughts. All things clear, Then J goes for implement the task accordingly.
```

### Occasion 2:
```
L: hear is the task for you, please finished it on time.
J: yes.then could you give me some instructions for the task.please?
L:Read the files carefully, don't always rely on asking me.Okay?
J:OK, got it.J take the seminal profile, and go to do it according his understanding for the paper information.
ok, here, for these two occassions, which one do you prefer?
Then, let me tell you the following result:
Occasion 1 everything goes well according the expectation,the seminar is very successful and the company received great praise in the market. 
Occasion 2 Lee was very depressed for the seminar, the Gereral manager chanllenged them the high expense. Johnson doesn't know the seminal have buget limitation and booked a luxury conference center, he even didn't give any feedback to Lee during the process becouse he think his boss want to see his ability.

See, different leader styles, different results,repeating is necessary in our daily work, repeating is a declaration to understand the task well, repeating is an emphasis to take a caution attitude. so whichever you leader style is in the past, try to repeating, the cost for repeating is much less than to redo the thing.
